      <h2>The story</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
          evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
          <span class="villagers"
            >“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.”</span
          >
          The farmer said, <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em> The next day the
          horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
          everybody came back and said,
          <span class="villagers"
            >“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
            eight horses!”</span
          >
          The farmer again said,
          <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
          riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
          <span class="villagers"
            >“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</span
          >
          and the farmer responded, <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em> The next
          day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the
          army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all
          the neighbors came around and said,
          <span class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</span> Again, he said,
          <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
          complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
          happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or
          <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the
          consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
          consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just
        one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys,
        but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's
        not make a big deal out of it...
